## How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

The typo was with a signal + (spacr), it´s really useful command, diff, merge, commit, all of them we are going to learn in this course. 



## How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I can see all history changes, and question the staff why you change A per B, or X per XX, then you understand the bussiness, new plans, new perspectives from this history. 
See how I learn in the entire code. :) 



## What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Commits are good to keep with sense your code, if you commit and save for every small line, could be hard do understand after some lines. 
The cons if you forget to commit after a big change. 
Automatically could be more simple and easy but can´t be as well a waste of time and resources, if you don´t do a real change this would be a not significant save. 



## Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because the Git has a behaviour like a repository(you can add 1 or more files) google docs save one file by one. 



## How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

it´s really useful commands
log:  you can find all commits and see a brief description
diff: can be use to check what they really change, where, when, great 



## How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

to be honest i am not so confident with the control version, for now I know only the basic, with my good experience in Linux and terminal until now my experience with the github commmands it´s ok, I mean I know and can understand the commands, now I need to know how to use. 



## Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to do some easy stuff and start learn python and than put / commit my codes in github.


#test, where are you#
